# Hexapod Dynamics
[Why don't hexapods gallop?](https://paulispace.com/robotics/2018/10/21/hexapods.html)

tl;dr: My working hypothesis is that (under the influence of sufficiently important gravitational
effects i.e. 1 Newton or greater) hexapods, regardless of brain wiring, aren't suitable for galloping gaits
